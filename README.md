In this course we were introduced to computer security with the objective to introduce concepts and principles of computer systems security. Notions of security, basic cryptographic primitives and their application, basics of authentication and access control, basics of key-management, basics of malware and software security. By the end of the course, we are able to:

- Understand the need for cyber security, key notions of security, and well established security principles and security mechanisms/controls
- Apply security controls including cryptographic primitives to secure systems while adhering to applicable security principles
- Critically evaluate system designs and security controls in place to identify security weaknesses
- Assess security requirements of systems and select security controls that areappropriate
- Describe common security properties and requirements, common security issues insystems and their implications
